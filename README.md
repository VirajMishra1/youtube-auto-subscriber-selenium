# YouTube Auto-Subscriber Bot - Selenium üé•

## Project Description

The **YouTube Auto-Subscriber Bot** is a Python-based tool that automates subscribing to YouTube channels and helps transfer subscriptions from one account to another. By utilizing Selenium, the script logs into a Gmail account, navigates to the specified YouTube channels, and subscribes to them if not already subscribed. The tool is designed for efficient and hands-free channel subscription management.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Automated Gmail Login**: The bot securely logs into a Gmail account using Selenium.
2. **Channel Subscription**: Automatically subscribes to channels listed in a text file.
3. **Smart Detection**: Detects if the user is already subscribed to a channel and skips unnecessary actions.
4. **Headless Browser Mode**: Runs the browser in headless mode for faster execution and reduced resource usage.
5. **System Awake Functionality**: Prevents the system from sleeping during script execution using `caffeinate`.
6. **Error Handling**: Handles exceptions during login and subscription to ensure smooth operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Selenium**: For browser automation.
- **caffeinate**: Keeps the system awake on macOS.
- **ChromeDriver**: Interface for controlling Google Chrome.

## üì¶ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd youtube-auto-subscriber
    ```
3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```
4. **Download ChromeDriver**:
   - Ensure that ChromeDriver is installed and added to your system PATH.
   - You can download it from [ChromeDriver Download Page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

5. **Edit Configuration**:
    - Replace the placeholder email, password, and file path in the script:
      ```python
      gmail_email = 'your_email@gmail.com'
      gmail_password = 'your_password'
      file_path = 'path_to_your_channel_list.txt'
      ```
    - The `file_path` should point to a text file containing YouTube channel URLs, one per line.

6. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python youtube_auto_subscriber.py
    ```

## üìù Usage

1. Prepare a text file with YouTube channel URLs, one URL per line. You retrieve your subscriptions from your existing account and ask https://www.perplexity.ai/ to make the text file. 
2. Replace your Gmail credentials and the file path in the script.
3. Run the script to log in to Gmail and subscribe to the channels automatically.
4. The script will indicate success, existing subscriptions, or any errors during the process.
